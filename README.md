oogle Street View, artificial landscapes or satellite imagery: nowadays, we look at nature through interface, machine legible translation of images. These new representations use a form language made of numbers, algorithms and vectors; they see beyond human eyes but are limited by their encoding system. In a form of a website which uses a program to generate satellite imagery from onsite pictures, the user is invited to explore the agency of the pixel: the smallest element of the image - and reflects on how it affects and abstracts our perception of nature.
